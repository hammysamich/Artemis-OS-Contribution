# Artemis-OS-Contribution

Artemis is a rewrite of Wynntils in Minecraft 1.20.2 using Architectury, to support Fabric and Forge mods. Its purpose is to enhance the gameplay experience of the Wynncraft Minecraft server by adding quality-of-life features and improvements, better HUD, and quest tracking. This project began in December 2021. It currently has 2,244 commits, 152 stars, and 74 forks. Artemis aims to improve players' overall enjoyment and engagement with the Wynncraft server. Its goal is to maintain compatibility with Fabric and Forge, which are modding platforms for Minecraft to support a wide range of player preferences and allow for a more diverse and inclusive gaming community. 

Not only does it enhance the experience for Wynncraft players, but Artemis fosters collaboration among developers, enabling them to contribute to a shared codebase. It also allows developers to learn from each other and improve their own programming skills. Since the project repository serves as a platform for innovation for modding, developers are encouraged to experiment and have fun trying new features and sharing these advancements with other developers in the Artemis gaming community. 

This tool is a consumer product and also functions as a developer tool. It is a consumer product because it enhances the Minecraft experience for players. As a developer tool, Artemis can provide insights and frameworks for developers who want to create and improve Minecraft mods. Rewriting Wynntils using Architectury, ensures that Artemis will be compatible with Minecraft's latest versions, and adding cross-platform support makes it accessible to a broader audience and fosters a more inclusive modding community. 

For newcomers to open-source projects, it is essential to begin by going through all the documentation and community guidelines of a project. By doing so, contributors can have a thorough understanding of the purpose and goals of the project. To get more acquainted with it, newcomers should begin with “smaller” tasks that are typically tagged with “good first issue” on 
GitHub. These tasks are meant to be manageable for beginners and usually are minor feature changes, documentation changes, and simple bug fixes. For most active open-source software projects, moderators will post a series of simple tasks to encourage newcomers to engage volunteers and introduce them to the community.

For any open-source contribution, the best practice in general is to follow the setup instructions properly. For this particular project, it's important to use the build commands given to ensure compatibility. Writing clear documentation for any original code written or changes made in any of the files is essential to maintain project consistency and enhance readability. Rigorous testing of your changes is also important to ensure that your contributions are not introducing new bugs or breaking the other parts of the project

Regarding the code of conduct, all contributors should treat all community developers with respect and professionalism. Engaging respectfully with the project community should be encouraged to support the continuous improvement of the project and allow developers to grow by providing feedback constructively. Pull requests contributing to projects should be clear and intentional in describing their purpose and changes. The changes from the pull request should be tested thoroughly, and developers who submit their pull requests should be open to feedback and willing to make further changes if necessary to improve the project. Overall, developers who contribute to open-source software should also ensure that their contributions align with the goals of the particular community. Their participation should always be consistent or improve the project's overall quality and direction.

One of the “starter” issues from Artemis is Issue #2542:

WAR_MESSAGE_PATTERN does not handle x minute and y second case

Current regex: "§3\\[WAR\\]§c The war for (?<territory>.+) will start in (?<remaining>.+) (?<type>minutes|seconds)\\."

[CHAT] &3[WAR]&c The war for Aldorei's Arch will start in 14 minutes and 59 seconds.

This issue addresses an error with an automated chat message. The problem addresses an issue with the regex pattern in the code. The message is supposed to announce the time when war events in the mod are supposed to occur, however, the current regex pattern does not handle the correct number of minutes and seconds that it is supposed to display. The technologies involved in contributing to this project and helping fix the issue would be Minecraft modding frameworks, Java, Java Development Kit (JDK), regex, Gradle, Git, and Github. I would estimate that this project would take me around 1 hour. Based on the description of the issue, this solution seems very simple because the regex pattern is incorrect. A new regex pattern can be created to handle both time units should be created. It is possible that only lines of code with that regex pattern need to be changed if the problem only lies within the pattern.
